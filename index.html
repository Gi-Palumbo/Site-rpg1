        <h5 class="title1">What is Role-playing Games?</h5>
        <p class="text">Its a game in which each participant assumes the role of a character, 
        generally in a fantasy or science fiction setting,
        that can interact within the game's imaginary world.</p>
        <p class="text1">The RPG appeared in the USA in 1971, with the creation of The Fantasy Game, renamed in 1974 as Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). D&D still exists today and is a medieval fantasy game strongly influenced by the novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.
        Its creators, Gary Gigax and Dave Arneson, were avid players of "war games", the initial idea they had was to play with characters instead of troops, and that each player only controls one of them.It arrived in Brazil in the 1980s, with university students who
        managed to import a book and photocopy it for their friends.In 1991, the first national game appeared Tagmar, of medieval fantasy and the first RPG translated into Portuguese GURPS, which proposed to make games possible in any type of scenario. In the 90s came 
        what would become a favorite around here: Vampiro, a MÃ¡scara, a horror game with more focus on the interpretation and personal drama of the characters. Around the year 2000, the Brazilian RPG came with everything, consolidating itself with Tormenta (also of medieval fantasy)
        and 3D&T (based on Japanese comics and video games), being successful until today.</p>
